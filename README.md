# Concurrent Matrix Operations
This is a simple console-based application developed in Java. The program explores more on the concepts of Concurrent programing more so than the functionalities. The program will create a matrix of a user defined size (change in the file) and input random integers (also user definable). The program then concurrently goes through each row and finds the highest, lower and the average of that row.<br /><br/>
***How to use this application***<br/>
```
java MatrixOperations
```
<br/>
***Example Output***<br/>
Below is an example output of the application when run:<br/>
```
[336, 588, 28, 969, 146, 114, 139, 492, 850, 745] -> (969, 28, 440.7)
```
<br/>
***To do***
- [ ] I'm unsure whether to implement user input instead of updating the source file. It's more understanding how thread works than actual utilisation.
- [ ] Add in extra functions (adding, subtracting, etc.)
